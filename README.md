A starter app for building apps in WinJS and React + ES6(babel) + postcss. Thanks to (https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react) for great react starter!

## Design Goals

- Use ES6 in UWP Apps! :)
- Test in browser or as UWP App in Visual Studio
- PostCSS, Babel 6 with Webpack and Hot Loader
- Use React-WinJS for create components 
- Import css files as class names
- No specific implementation of Flux or data fetching patterns


## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
$ npm run server
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080/** to view the app.

## Debug in Visual Studio

Build app:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Open the project folder in Visual Studio, and make sure that /build folder is included in project. Hot-reloading is unavailable in Visual Studio, so every change in code requires re-build project. It is better to debug in browser. 

## Commands

A core philosophy of this skeleton app is to keep the tooling to a minimum. For this reason, you can find all the commands in the `scripts` section of [package.json](package.json).

### server

```sh
$ npm run server
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

This leverages [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) to automatically start a local dev server and refresh file changes on the fly without reloading the page.

It also automatically includes source maps, allowing you to browse code and set breakpoints on the original ES6 code:

### build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

**Output:** `build/app.js`

Build minified app for production using the [production](http://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html#production-shortcut-p) shortcut.

### test

```sh
$ npm test
```

**Input:** `test/main.js`

**Output:** `coverage/`

Leverages [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) to execute the test suite and generate code coverage reports using [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)

### coveralls

```sh
$ npm run coveralls
```

**Input:** `coverage/lcov.info`

Sends the code coverage report generated by [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io/).

### clean

```sh
$ npm run clean
```

**Input:** `build/app.js`

Removes the compiled app file from build.

## Known Issues

Move css from WinJS to webpack loader.
